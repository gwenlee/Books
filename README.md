# Books
SQL Assignment practiced through the university paper

Data and the content is taught and learned as a part of Infosys 222 from Johnny Chan https://github.com/noct15 <br>

The code is from Gwen Lee https://github.com/gwenlee <br>

There are five different questions throughout the SQLite database.

<br>

**Description for the data**
There are 11 different data which contain each important information. (ER Modelling is available upon request)

**4 Questions from the assignment**
1. Checking out how many inventory has left. The outcome should be able to show the name of books and the left quantities.
2. Total salary comparision between Manager and Non-manager. The percentage shows the salary distribution between Manager and Non-manager as well.
3. Labelling the grade of books and showing the name of books with the released year. Example as 'High,  A Loud Game (2004)' when comma divides into two columns.
4. Checking the staff name and showing the status of staff members whether they are currently hired at the book store. Also there is duration which shows how long the employee has been working at the company, if the employee is not active at the company (i.e. if the person is not working for the company anymore) it should show the duration how long the employee had been working for.
